The process of supplier selection is an essential function aimed at increasing the operational efficiency
and competitiveness of supply chains. This paper introduces a hybrid framework integrating the
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal
Solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate and select suppliers in the textile industry. We use AHP to determine
accurate, normalized weights for the important criteria of the problem: cost, quality, delivery time,
reliability, flexibility, and sustainability. Utilizing these weights, TOPSIS calculates the rankings for
the suppliers based on how close they are to ideal and anti-ideal solutions. The framework cuts the
trade-offs between quantitative and qualitative efficiencies, such as cost efficiency versus sustainability.
Real-world application of the model demonstrates its efficacy in supplier selection that pays attention
to strategic goals in order to improve the accuracy of decision and lead to resilient and sustainable
supply chains. Bridging conventional methodologies and providing a scalable adaptable solution for
complex supplier evaluation challenges, this hybrid approach copes with gaps.
